AWS_tidbits
===========

Some scripts and stuff that I don't want to lose.

Most of the scripts in here are pieces of Ruby code that manipulates and/or creates AWS instances.

Also some Redis stuff.

A lot of this stuff are chunks from some automation tools I play around with. They're mostly incomplete but demonstrate some principles of how I interact with AWS. Some of the things in here involve storing AWS information in a NoSQL data store, deploying instance with Chef/Knife, checking the health of Java artifacts in Glassfish, load balancer switching (haproxy), automating load balancer switching, etc.

It's fairly sparse in here but most of the code I write is proprietary.
