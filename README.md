AWS_tidbits
===========

Some scripts and stuff that I don't want to lose.

Most of the scripts in here are pieces of Ruby code that manipulates and/or creates AWS instances.

Also some Redis stuff.

A lot of this stuff are chunks from some automation tools I play around with. They're mostly incomplete but demonstrate some principles of how I interact with AWS. Some of the things in here involve storing AWS information in a NoSQL data store, deploying instance with Chef/Knife, checking the health of Java artifacts in Glassfish, load balancer switching (haproxy), automating load balancer switching, etc.

Most of the stuff I've learned came from an Engineer named Ryan Greget (https://github.com/rgreget) who orginally exposed me to Redis, Ruby, and some other technologies. Props to him for showing me the ropes enough so that I could 'run my own ship', so to speak.

It's fairly sparse in here but most of the code I write is proprietary.
